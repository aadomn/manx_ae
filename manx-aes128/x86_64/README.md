# Manx-AES128 with AESNI instructions

This folder contains implementations of Manx1-AES128 and Manx2-AES128 relying on a constant-time AES implementation using on AESNI instructions.
The main purpose of this folder is to provide an implementation to run tests on x86_64 processors.

A toy example is provided in `test/main.c`.
